# Studio Laussat

**A creative production house for apps, media, and digital experiences.**

We operate at the intersection of precise geometry and organic craft. Our work is defined by the "Alchemist" archetype—blending rigid structures with fluid, watercolor aesthetics.

### Workstreams
- **Apps:** Publishing distinct, polished mobile applications.
- **Design:** Exploring philographics, motion, and visual systems.
- **Media:** Producing content that tells the story of our craft.
